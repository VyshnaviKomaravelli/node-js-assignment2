CALLBACK FUNCTIONS:
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument,
which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
   whenever asynchronous actions are performing in javascript we may not guarantee the order of execution.
   But we need some actions to be performed only after certaiin actions to be performed.In that case we use CALLBACK functions.
   These callback functions gets executed only after executing the another function.Hence,it is naed as Callback.
   ----------------->
   Eg:
   we have a code to load a new script in javascript file then we use
          loadScript('/my/script.js');
          
          then after loading it we may want to perform certain action.But its execution may happen before the loading takes place resulting in an error
          
          loadScript('/my/script.js');
// the code below loadScript doesn't wait for the script loading to finish
// ...

then,we use callbacks as follows:

      loadScript('/my/script.js', function() {
      // the callback runs after the script is loaded
      newFunction(); // so now it works
       ...
      });
      
     This is the mai use of callbacks.
